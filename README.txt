This program is designed to take a list of airports, city populations, and plane information. It uses a hypothetical algorithm to determine how many people fly from one city to another. It first filters through all airports and cities to find only the airports in cities with large populations. You can determine the traffic from one city to another, determine all the traffic from one airport, display all planes used by the airline company, and add a new airplane. Text must be formatted exactly or the program will exit.
